# time_service
time_service task from faceit 

# Challenge:

Write a module named `TimeService`, that has 2 classes, an initialize method and can be
received configuration params with a block.
### Requirements:
* Use Ruby, and write production quality code.
* Your module name should be `TimeService` and not inherit from another module.
* Must have 2 classes within the module
* One class must inherit from the other
* One class must have an initialize method
* Must be able to initialize with a block
 
 Within the subclass write a method that accepts two mandatory arguments and returns a result.
### Requirements:
* Your function or method should not use any date/time library.
* The first argument is a time value in the form of a string with the following format: [H]H:MM {AM|PM}.
* The second argument is the number of minutes, as an integer value.
* The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first argument, which is a result of adding the minutes to the time.
 
###   For example 
`add_minutes('9:13 AM', 10)` would return 9:23 AM.
